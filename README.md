**EDPM** is the name of the course “Experimental Data Processing Methods” on which this utility was developed.
---
Provides features such as:
* Reading files of different formats
* Selection of trends / correlation / mean deviation / mean square / eccentricity (and some other methods for primary data analysis)
* Methods for three-level data processing (for example: noise reduction and data correction, segmentation and representation of objects, object recognition)
* Saving / displaying final and intermediate results


###### Some code is not implemented in an optimal way, so there was a short time to implement it without a clear description of the structure of the entire application.
